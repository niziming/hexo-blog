# 英语模拟面试01



## 简介

#### **1. Introduction and Small Talk**

- interviewer：**Hi Simon, how are you today? How are you finding New Zealand so far?**

> "I'm doing great, thank you. I've been really **impressed** by the friendly culture and the beautiful landscapes here in New Zealand. When I was young, I watched many movies like *The Lord of the Rings*, *The Hobbit*, and *King Kong*. I later learned that these movies were filmed in New Zealand, which made me believe there must be a lot of beautiful **scenery** here, and it really attracts me."

#### **2. Self-Introduction**

- 面试官：**Can you please introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your professional background?**

你可以说：

> "Well, I have more than five years of experience in the field of software development, mostly focused on **backend** development using Java and the Spring framework technology stack. I have some experience in **frontend** development as well, particularly with JavaScript and Vue.js. I’ve worked on several related projects, such as an internet loan platform, a smart airport platform, and a WEBGIS series of projects.
>
> Most of these projects were based on the Spring technology stack, where we used Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Gateway to build the application servers for our clients and customers. We used Docker to deploy our services, and various middleware was managed through Docker according to the project requirements. Additionally, I worked on iterating and improving the software as the requirements evolved.

#### **3. Technical Questions**

- 面试官：**Tell us about a technical challenge you faced in one of your projects and how you solved it.**

你可以回答：

> ""One of the biggest challenges I faced was in an **WebGIS**  (**Geographical** Information System) software project. In that scenario, we needed to implement browser support for rendering 3D models based on geographical data. My role in the project was to calculate and **persist** the geographical data, and then **transmit** it to the frontend using a WebSocket **protocol**. The frontend used the **Cesium** framework to render the 3D models.
>
> In this context, I calculated the 2D(2 **Dimensional**) area of various shapes and projected these areas onto a 3D globe. However, I realized there was a **loss** of **accuracy** when mapping the flat areas onto the **curved** surface of the globe. After investigating, I found that a correction factor was needed to account for this distortion. Initially, the **collision** and intersection of volumes were not precise, which led me to discover this issue.
>
> Once I calculated and applied the correction factor, the areas matched perfectly, and the collisions became much more accurate. This challenge occurred during my first job, and while my technical skills were not yet fully developed at the time, I managed to resolve the issue successfully.""

#### 4.How do you ensure security in the systems you develop?

A: "Mostly, we use the Spring Security framework to ensure the security and authorization of our systems. For example, in one of our projects, like the loan platform, we **integrated** Spring Security within the gateway framework to manage authentication and authorization **efficiently**. We also implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure our APIs and ensure safe access to user data. This combination helps protect the system from from **unauthorized** access and ensures that only verified users can **interact** with **sensitive** data."

#### **4. Behavioral Questions**

- 面试官：**Can you give an example of a time when you worked under pressure and how you handled it?**

回答：

> "At one point, during the deployment of a new feature in the Smart Airport platform, we encountered critical security vulnerabilities just before the go-live. I worked closely with the security team to identify and patch the vulnerabilities. We conducted multiple rounds of testing within a tight deadline, and despite the pressure, we successfully deployed the project on time without any security breaches."

#### **5. Company Fit Questions**

- 面试官：**Why do you want to work in H and what interests you about this company?**

你可以说：

> **Candidate:**
> "My wife is currently studying at a college in Hong Kong, so I've visited the city many times over the past few years. I’ve grown to really appreciate Hong Kong, its culture, and its environment. When I was young, I watched many movies and listened to a lot of music from Hong Kong, which made me interested in the city even from a young age.
>
> As for this company, I read the job description carefully, and I feel that it matches my skills and experience very well. I’ve also researched the company’s background and achievements, and I’m very interested in the opportunity to work in this role and contribute to your team."

#### **6. Questions for the Employer**

- 面试官：**Do you have any questions for us?**

你可以问：

> "Yes, I would love to know more about the team I would be working with. How does the team collaborate on projects, and what technologies do you prioritize for your development processes?"
