# Interview for English



## Exercise 1

**1. Introduction and Small Talk**

- interviewer：**Hi Simon, how are you today? How are you finding Hong Kong so far?**

> "I'm doing great, thank you. I've been really **impressed** by the friendly culture and the beautiful landscapes here in Hong Kong. When I was young, I watched many movies like **...**. I later learned that these movies were filmed in Hong Kong, which made me believe there must be a lot of beautiful **scenery** here, and it really attracts me."

#### **2. Self-Introduction**

- 面试官：**Can you please introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your professional background?**

你可以说：

> "Sure. My name is Simon Ngai, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I have more than five years of experience in the field of software development, mostly focused on **backend** development using Java and the Spring framework technology stack. I have some experience in **frontend** development as well, particularly with JavaScript and Vue.js. I’ve worked on several related projects, such as an internet loan platform, a smart airport platform, and a WEBGIS series of projects.
>
> Most of these projects were based on the Spring technology stack, where we used Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Gateway to build the application servers for our clients and customers. We used Docker to deploy our services, and various middleware was managed through Docker according to the project requirements. Additionally, I worked on iterating and improving the software as the requirements evolved.

#### **3. Technical Questions**

- 面试官：**Tell us about a technical challenge you faced in one of your projects and how you solved it.**

你可以回答：

> "One of the biggest challenges I faced was in an **WebGIS**  (**Geographical** Information System) software project. In that scenario, we needed to implement browser support for rendering 3D models based on geographical data. My role in the project was to calculate and **persist** the geographical data, and then **transmit** it to the frontend using a WebSocket **protocol**. The frontend used the **Cesium** framework to render the 3D models.
>
> In this context, I calculated the 2D(2 **Dimensional**) area of various shapes and projected these areas onto a 3D globe. However, I realized there was a **loss** of **accuracy** when mapping the flat areas onto the **curved** surface of the globe. After investigating, I found that a correction factor was needed to account for this distortion. Initially, the **collision** and intersection of volumes were not precise, which led me to discover this issue.
>
> Once I calculated and applied the correction factor, the areas matched perfectly, and the collisions became much more accurate. This challenge occurred during my first job, and while my technical skills were not yet fully developed at the time, I managed to resolve the issue successfully.""

#### 4.How do you ensure security in the systems you develop?

A: "Mostly, we use the Spring Security framework to ensure the security and authorization of our systems. For example, in one of our projects, like the loan platform, we **integrated** Spring Security within the gateway framework to manage authentication and authorization **efficiently**. We also implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure our APIs and ensure safe access to user data. This combination helps protect the system from from **unauthorized** access and ensures that only verified users can **interact** with **sensitive** data."

#### **4. Behavioral Questions**

- 面试官：**Can you give an example of a time when you worked under pressure and how you handled it?**

回答：

> "At one point, during the deployment of a new feature in the Smart Airport platform, we encountered critical security vulnerabilities just before the go-live. I worked closely with the security team to identify and patch the vulnerabilities. We conducted multiple rounds of testing within a tight deadline, and despite the pressure, we successfully deployed the project on time without any security breaches."

#### **5. Company Fit Questions**

- 面试官：**Why do you want to work in Hong Kong and what interests you about this company?**

你可以说：

> **Candidate:**
> "My wife is currently studying at a college in Hong Kong, so I've visited the city many times over the past few years. I’ve grown to really appreciate Hong Kong, its culture, and its fast-paced environment. When I was young, I watched many Hong Kong movies featuring actors, which made me interested in the city even from a young age.
>
> As for this company, I read the job description carefully, and I feel that it matches my skills and experience very well. I’ve also researched the company’s background and achievements, and I’m very interested in the opportunity to work in this role and contribute to your team."

#### **6. Questions for the Employer**

- 面试官：**Do you have any questions for us?**

你可以问：

> "Yes, I would love to know more about the team I would be working with. How does the team collaborate on projects, and what technologies do you prioritize for your development processes?"





## Exercise 2

Sure! I'll simulate each of the questions and provide sample answers as if I were responding in an interview setting.

### **Technical Questions:**

**1. Can you explain the difference between RESTful APIs and SOAP?**  
RESTful APIs are lightweight and use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations. They are stateless and often return data in formats like JSON or XML. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a more complex, protocol-based API, which uses XML for messaging and includes built-in security and transactional features. REST is more flexible and easier to use for web services, while SOAP is better suited for enterprise-level security and reliability needs.

**2. How does Garbage Collection work in Java?**  
Garbage Collection in Java automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory from objects that are no longer in use. It uses different algorithms, like the generational GC, which divides the heap into the young and old generations. The young generation uses the Copying Garbage Collection algorithm, while the old generation uses the Mark-Sweep-Compact algorithm to remove unused objects.

**3. What are microservices, and how have you used them in your projects?**  
Microservices are an architectural style where an application is broken down into smaller, independent services, each focused on a specific business capability. In my projects, I’ve used Spring Boot to develop microservices and used Spring Cloud for service discovery, load balancing, and centralized configuration. Each microservice interacts with others over lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging systems like Kafka.

**4. How would you optimize a slow SQL query?**  
To optimize a slow SQL query, I would first analyze the query execution plan to identify bottlenecks. I would consider adding appropriate indexes, rewriting subqueries as joins, and limiting the number of rows fetched. If needed, I could also consider partitioning tables, optimizing database configurations, or using caching mechanisms.

**5. Explain multithreading and concurrency in Java.**  
Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a program, improving efficiency. Java provides the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface for creating threads. To manage concurrency, Java offers mechanisms like synchronized blocks, `Lock` objects, and higher-level tools like `ExecutorService` to manage thread pools, ensuring proper coordination between threads and avoiding race conditions.

**6. Can you explain how you’ve implemented JWT for user authentication in your projects?**  
In my projects, I’ve used JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless user authentication. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing claims like the user ID, expiration time, and roles. This token is signed with a secret key and passed to the client. For each subsequent request, the token is sent in the Authorization header, and the server verifies its signature before granting access.

**7. What are the benefits of using Docker in a production environment?**  
Docker provides consistency across development, testing, and production environments by packaging an application and its dependencies in a container. This ensures that the application behaves the same, regardless of where it’s deployed. Docker also enables scalability, faster deployment times, and resource isolation, making it easier to manage complex microservice architectures.

**8. How do you ensure scalability and performance in a distributed system?**  
To ensure scalability and performance, I use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers and scale services horizontally. I also implement caching layers (like Redis) to reduce database load and use asynchronous messaging (like Kafka) for decoupling services. For monitoring, I set up tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance and auto-scale services as needed.

**9. What’s the difference between NoSQL and SQL databases, and when would you use one over the other?**  
SQL databases are relational and use structured query language to manage data in tables with predefined schemas. NoSQL databases are more flexible, handling unstructured or semi-structured data in formats like key-value, document, or graph stores. I would choose SQL for applications requiring complex queries and ACID compliance, while NoSQL is better suited for large-scale, distributed systems requiring scalability and flexibility.

**10. Can you walk us through the Spring Security framework and how you’ve used it to secure an application?**  
Spring Security is a powerful framework that provides authentication, authorization, and security features. In my projects, I’ve used Spring Security to implement role-based access control and integrate with JWT for stateless authentication. I configured it using `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` to define security filters, restricted access to specific endpoints based on user roles, and ensured CSRF protection.

### **Problem-Solving & Algorithm Questions:**

**1. How would you approach solving a memory leak issue?**  
To solve a memory leak issue, I would start by profiling the application using tools like VisualVM or JProfiler to identify objects that are not being garbage collected. I would check for common issues such as static references, unclosed resources, or improper caching. Once identified, I would refactor the code to ensure objects are properly disposed of when no longer needed.

**2. Can you describe how to handle deadlock in a multi-threaded environment?**  
Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other’s resources. To prevent deadlock, I would ensure a consistent locking order and use timeouts for resource acquisition. Additionally, I could implement lock-free algorithms or use higher-level concurrency utilities from the `java.util.concurrent` package, like `ReentrantLock` with tryLock, to avoid deadlocks.

**3. Write a program to find the longest palindrome in a string.**

```java
public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
    if (s == null || s.length() < 1) return "";
    int start = 0, end = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);
        int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
        int len = Math.max(len1, len2);
        if (len > end - start) {
            start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
            end = i + len / 2;
        }
    }
    return s.substring(start, end + 1);
}

private int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
        left--;
        right++;
    }
    return right - left - 1;
}
```

**4. How would you detect and resolve circular dependencies in a project?**  
To detect circular dependencies, I would use dependency analysis tools or check for tightly coupled modules. To resolve them, I would break the dependencies by using design patterns like Dependency Injection or refactoring classes to reduce coupling, ensuring the components interact more loosely.

**5. Can you implement a binary search algorithm?**

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**6. Explain how you would debug a program that’s causing high CPU usage.**  
I would start by using monitoring tools like `top` or `htop` to identify which process is consuming the most CPU. Then, I would profile the application using tools like VisualVM to track CPU usage per thread. I would examine the code for inefficient loops, excessive logging, or resource-heavy operations. Refactoring or optimizing the code can help resolve the issue.

### **Behavioral Questions:**

**1. Can you describe a time when you had to work under a tight deadline? How did you manage it?**  
I was once tasked with delivering a critical feature for a client on short notice. To manage the deadline, I broke the work into smaller tasks, prioritized the most critical ones, and collaborated closely with my team. I also communicated regularly with stakeholders to set expectations and ensure there were no blockers.

**2. Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly for a project.**  
In a recent project, we had to implement a message broker using RabbitMQ, which I hadn’t worked with before. I quickly went through the documentation, followed tutorials, and experimented with a local setup. Within a week, I was able to integrate RabbitMQ into our microservices architecture.

**3. How do you handle conflicts within a development team?**  
When conflicts arise, I ensure open communication between team members. I encourage everyone to share their perspectives and actively listen to each other. If necessary, I mediate by focusing on the issue rather than the individuals, and we collaboratively work towards a solution that benefits the project.

**4. Describe a situation where you received negative feedback. How did you handle it?**  
I once received feedback that my code reviews were too detailed and took too much time. I took the feedback constructively and adjusted my approach by focusing on the most critical aspects, ensuring the process was more efficient while maintaining quality.

**5. Tell me about a time when you encountered a technical failure. How did you resolve it?**  
During a deployment, we encountered a system failure due to a misconfigured load balancer. We quickly rolled back the changes and identified the issue through logs. After fixing the configuration, I implemented automated tests to validate the load balancer settings before future deployments.
